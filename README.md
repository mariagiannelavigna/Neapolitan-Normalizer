# Neapolitan Normalizer on Nooj
[Nooj App](https://nooj.univ-fcomte.fr/downloads.html)

This project aims to develop an automatic tool — Normalizer — for converting non-standard Neapolitan word forms into their standardized equivalents. The problem lies in the fact that, nowadays, Neapolitan is written online in highly variable ways that differ significantly from its standardized orthographic form. For instance, on social media platforms — such as TikTok — Neapolitan is often written in phonetic forms (“by ears”), which can hinder comprehension and differ significantly from standardized orthographic conventions. This can result as a problem, especially for researchers who study the language and try to make computer programs based on Neapolitan Language.

The analysis, on the other hand, targets lexical forms occurring in online contexts, with particular attention to posts and comments on social media platforms, such as: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

The purpose of this project is to address two main issues: the first relates to the fact that people spell Neapolitan words in many different ways. The other problem is that people often make spelling mistakes because they are writing it the way they speak. By addressing these challenges, the system seeks to support the automatic standardization of Neapolitan lexical forms in digital communication.

The normalization rules adopted in this project are grounded in a formal grammatical approach aimed at ensuring a standardized written representation of Neapolitan. Standard forms are defined on the basis of authoritative linguistic sources, most notably the Dizionario Dialettale Napoletano by Antonio Altamura, alongside previous studies on Neapolitan orthography and grammar, like “Una lingua gentile. Storia e grafia del napoletano” by Nicola De Blasi and Francesco Montuori and “Grammatica Diacronica del napoletano” by Adam Ledgeway. These references provide the linguistic framework needed to distinguish between commonly used non-standard forms and their standardized counterparts. This project examines how Neapolitan has been written in digital contexts over the past five-ten years, with particular attention to non-standard spelling practices. These forms are then compared with their standardized equivalents in order to identify recurring patterns and formulate normalization rules that map non-standard spellings to standard ones.

The next step of our project involves implementing the identified normalization rules within a formal grammar for Neapolitan, developed using the NooJ linguistic platform. NooJ allows for the encoding and systematic testing of these rules on real linguistic data, enabling the evaluation of their effectiveness in handling non-standard written forms.

The main outcome of the project is a preliminary — yet functional — lexical normalization system for informal Neapolitan. This resource shows that formal grammatical modeling can be applied to low-resource and non-standardized language varieties in digital contexts. In addition to its immediate results, the project highlights the importance of linguistic normalization for the study and computational processing of dialectal languages.

In future work, we hope for the dataset to be expanded and the normalization rules to be refined
for dialect processing and sociolinguistic research.
